This is an experimental yet fully functional TensorFlow implementation of word embedding algorithm Word2Vec by Mikolov et al. This implementation supports both model architecture, **Skip-gram** and **Continuous bag-of-words**, as well as both training algorithms, **negative sampling** and **hierarchical softmax**.
